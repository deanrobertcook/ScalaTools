## Current Activity
More as a reminder to myself, I'm currently working on learning more about machine learning and data science etc. Started following: 
* [Machine Learning on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome). Currently on the week 2 assignemnt about linear regression
* [Kaggle titanic problem](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
 * [Interesting analysis of the problem](https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/titanic/exploring-survival-on-the-titanic)


## TODO 
* Would be nice to get some 3D plotting up and running - look into [jzy3d](https://github.com/jzy3d/jzy3d-api)

## Other interesting resources to look into:
* [The ScalaNLP Project](http://www.scalanlp.org/)
* [Kaggle Kernels](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels) (might be good for (re)learning python or R)
* [SO Scala Documentation](http://stackoverflow.com/documentation/scala/topics) - lots of good stuff there!
